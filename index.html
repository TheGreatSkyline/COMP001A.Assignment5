                service industry. This narrative explores the history of

                of creating a garage that prioritized quality and accessibility. 
                Initially operating out of a single-car garage, he focused on 
                providing basic services such as oil changes, tire rotations, and 
                minor repairs. With limited resources but an abundance of 
                determination, Joaquin spent long hours honing his skills and 
                building a reputation for reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those early days, he relied heavily on word-of-mouth referrals. 
                He offered competitive pricing and exceptional service, which grew, 
                so did his business. By the end of 2007, Jobba Inc. was able to expand
                its services to include more complex repairs, such as brake work and engine
                diagnostics.
